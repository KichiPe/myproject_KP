## Get started:

Load necessary libraries:
```{r, echo=T, message=F}
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)
```



Choose and filter needed data

```{r}
#load hfi data and filter for year 2016

hfi_2016 <- hfi %>% filter(year == 2016)

```

## Question 1:  
Copy your model from the previous exercise that uses  `pf_expression_control` to predict Human Freedom or `hf_score`. Using the `tidy` command, what does the slope tell us in the context of the relationship between human freedom and expression control in the country?


```{r}
lm_hf_vs_pf <- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)
tidy(lm_hf_vs_pf)
glance(lm_hf_vs_pf)

```

Answer:  
We expect for countries with a `pf_expression_control` of 0 (x = 0) a `hf_score` of 5.05. The slope has a value of  
0.368, which means that for every 1 unit increase in `pf_expression_control`, the mean `hf_score` increases 0.368 units.
$R^2$ is 0.629.

 

## Question 2:
Add region to the model from Q1 using `lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control + region, data = hfi_2016)`. What do you notice about the slope between human freedom and expression control? How has it changed from the previous model. Do you think region is a confounder, and think about reasons why this might be so? 

```{r}
lm_hf_vs_pf_rg <- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control + region, data = hfi_2016)
summary(lm_hf_vs_pf_rg)
tidy(lm_hf_vs_pf_rg)

```

Calculation of the change in slope of the two models in %.
```{r}

perc1 <- ((tidy(lm_hf_vs_pf)[2,2]  -  tidy(lm_hf_vs_pf_rg)[2,2]) / tidy(lm_hf_vs_pf)[2,2] ) *100
round(perc1, 1)

```


Answer:  
Slope decreased from 0.368 to 0.275 when region was added as a further predictor. This means, that the influence of pf-expression-control becomes smaller. The region could be a potential confounder, since there are different government systems in various regions, which have influence on `hf_score` as well as on `pf_expression_control`. A rule of thumb is that if the slope changes by more than 10% with a new predictor, it is a potential confounder. By adding region to the model, the slope changes about 25.4 % and consequently could be a confounder.




## Question 3:
Compare the $R^2$ for the 2 models from Q1 and Q2. Is there an increase by adding region?   
Think about the definition of $R^2$. What does this mean in this context?

```{r }
glance(lm_hf_vs_pf)
glance(lm_hf_vs_pf_rg)
```

Answer:  
For model 1 when comparing 'hf_score' and 'pf_expression_control' $R^2$ has a value of 0.692.  
Meaning that 69,2 % of the variability of `hf_score` can be explained by `pf_expression_control`. While adding `region`  
as predictor, $R^2$ rises to 0.754. Consequently 75.4 % of `hf_score` variability can be explained by the model.  



## Question 4:
Fit a new model that uses `ef_money` or monetary measure to predict `hf_score`. What does the slope tell us in the context of the relationship between human freedom and the economy in the country? 

```{r}
lm_hf_vs_ef <- lm(hf_score ~ ef_money, data = hfi_2016)
summary(lm_hf_vs_ef)
glance(lm_hf_vs_ef)
```

Answer:   
The slope has the value of 0.503 which is higher than in the previous models. Thus, a change in `ef_money` has a higher influence on the `hf_score`. An increase in the economy of the country thus has a stronger effect on human freedom. $R^2$ with a value of 0.425 is, however, relatively low compared to the previous models.   



## Question 5:
Again add region to the model from Q4. Compare the slope and $R^2$ with the model from Q4.

```{r cars}
lm_hf_vs_ef_re <- lm(hf_score ~ ef_money + region, data = hfi_2016)
summary(lm_hf_vs_ef_re)
tidy(lm_hf_vs_ef_re)
glance(lm_hf_vs_ef_re)

```

Calculation of the change in slope of the two models in %.
```{r}
perc2 <-  ((tidy(lm_hf_vs_ef)[2,2]  -  tidy(lm_hf_vs_ef_re)[2,2]) / tidy(lm_hf_vs_ef)[2,2] ) *100
round(perc2, 1)
```

Answer:  
Adding the region increases $R^2$ from 0.425 to 0.744, almost doubling it. This means that 74.4% of the variances can now be explained by the model.  
The slope, on the other hand, decreases from 0.503 to 0.364. Thus, an increase of ef_money by 1 unit now has a smaller effect on the hf_score. In this model, the slope changes by 27.7 % by adding region and is thus a potential confounder.   



## Question 6:
Finally fit a model with `ef_money` and `pf_expression_control` as exposures and `hf_score` as outcome.    
Compare the slope and $R^2$ from the models from Q1. Could `ef_money` be a confounder? 

```{r}
lm_hf_vs_ef_pf <- lm(hf_score ~ ef_money + pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)
summary(lm_hf_vs_ef_pf)
tidy(lm_hf_vs_ef_pf)
glance(lm_hf_vs_ef_pf)
```

Calculation of the change in slope of the two models in %.
```{r}
perc3 <-  ((tidy(lm_hf_vs_pf)[2,2]  -  tidy(lm_hf_vs_ef_pf)[3,2] ) / tidy(lm_hf_vs_pf)[2,2] ) *100
round(perc3, 1)
```

Answer: In Q1 the slope had a value of 0.368 and $R^2$ of 0.629
In this model the slope of pf_expression control is 0.296 and for ef_money 0.317. $R^2$ increased to 0.774. Thus, the model of Q6 explains more of the variability of hf_score than the model of Q1.
The slope of pf_expression control decreases from 0.368 in Q1 to 0.296 in Q6 about 19.6 % and therefore indicating that ef_money is a confounder. 



## Question 7:
Use a linear regression model (and scatter plot) with  `ef_money` as exposure and `pf_expression_control` as outcome,  
to study whether `ef_money` has an association with `pf_expression_control` as well.  
This might validate our finding that `ef_money` is a confounder between  `pf_expression_control` as exposure   
and `hf_score` as outcome from Q6.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfi_2016, aes(x = ef_money, y=pf_expression_control))+
  geom_point(size =3.5, col= "darkblue", alpha = 0.7)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, col ="grey18")+
  ggtitle("Ef-money vs pf-expression-control")+
  theme_light()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

m1 <- lm(pf_expression_control ~ ef_money, data = hfi_2016)
glance(m1)
```

Calculation of the correlation of ef_money and pf_expression_control:
```{r}
cor_ef_pf <- (cor(hfi_2016$ef_money, hfi_2016$pf_expression_control))
round(cor_ef_pf, 3)
```

Answer: To predict an outcome, the used exposures should be independent from each other. In the scatter plot ef_money and pf_expression_control seem to be slightly correlated when ef_money is higher than 4.5. But $R^2$ is very low with 14.3 %, meaning than only a small portion of the variance of pf_expression control can be explained by ef_money. Also the correlation between these two predictors is only 0.378, which is no strong correlation.  
You should set a maximum threshold at the beginning of the analysis, which degree of correlation you accept from (independent) two predictors. In this case, I would say that ef_money is not a confounder and ef_money and pf_expression_control can be used to predict the hf_score.
